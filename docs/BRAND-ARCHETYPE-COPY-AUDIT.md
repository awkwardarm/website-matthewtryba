# Brand Archetype Copy Audit & Recommendations

## Your Brand Formula
- **Hero (70%):** Mastery, competence, triumph over challenges, proving your worth, being the best
- **Caregiver (25%):** Nurturing, safety, trust, service, protecting the artist's vision
- **Sage (5%):** Wisdom, insight, understanding what makes music work

---

## What's Already Working

Your **testimonials** are your strongest archetype-aligned asset. They organically hit all three:
- **Hero:** "his ear training is unmatched," "the strongest it can be"
- **Caregiver:** "professional and patient," "easy to work with," "listening to what my needs were," "capitalizing on your strengths"
- **Sage:** "great visionary," "a song that needed direction"

The landing page's **"Dream Outcome" section** is also strong Caregiver copy — it names the artist's pain and promises to remove it.

## What Needs Work (Page by Page)

### 1. HOME PAGE (`home-page.html`)

#### Hero headline — currently too passive

**Current:**
> "From Song Ideas to Release"

This is descriptive but not heroic. It doesn't convey mastery or transformation.

**Suggested:**
> "Your Song, Elevated to Its Full Potential"
>
> or
>
> "World-Class Production for Artists Who Demand More"

---

#### Hero subheadline — buried lead

**Current:**
> "I'm a Denver based pop, adult contemporary, and dark pop music producer specializing in transforming your raw song ideas into professional, streaming ready recordings with RIAA Diamond certified quality."

This is genre/location-heavy. Lead with the heroic transformation, then support.

**Suggested:**
> "I bring 15 years of major-label expertise to transform your raw ideas into records that compete at the highest level. Specializing in Pop, Adult Contemporary, and Dark Pop."

---

#### "Your Partner In Music" section — good Caregiver, weak Hero

**Current:**
> "...which gave me a masterclass in what separates a good song from a global hit."

This is actually a **Sage** line (knowledge) doing the work your **Hero** line should.

**Suggested heading:**
> "Your Partner In Greatness"

**Suggested body:**
> "My career began engineering records that went Diamond and won Grammys — not by accident, but by relentlessly pursuing the highest standard on every song. Now, I bring that same uncompromising process to every artist I work with."

---

#### "How I Can Help" service cards — currently flat/generic

**Full Production — Current:**
> "An end to end service taking your raw idea to a commercially competitive, streaming ready master."

**Suggested:**
> "I take ownership of the entire journey — from your first idea to a master that holds its own against anything on the charts."

---

**Mixing — Current:**
> "Achieve a polished, professional sound highlights your song's emotion."

*(Also has a typo — missing "that")*

**Suggested:**
> "A mix that doesn't just sound polished — it makes listeners *feel* what you intended."

---

**Vocal Production — Current:**
> "Crafting powerful, authentic vocal performances that make your songs unforgettable."

**Suggested:**
> "Your voice is the soul of your song. I'll draw out your most powerful, authentic performance and build the entire production to serve it."

---

#### Contact form heading

**Current:**
> "Tell Me About Your Project" / "Ready to elevate your music? Send me a message!"

The Caregiver angle is missing.

**Suggested heading:**
> "Tell Me About Your Vision"
>
> *(You already use this on the landing page — be consistent)*

**Suggested subtitle:**
> "I read every message personally and respond within one business day. Let's figure out the best path forward for your music."

---

### 2. ABOUT PAGE (`about.html`)

This page leans heavily Sage (knowledge/credentials) and is underweight on Hero and Caregiver.

#### Headline

**Current:**
> "From Global Hits to Your Next Song"

Decent but positions you as a history lesson. A Hero framing would be:

**Suggested:**
> "The Standard I Hold Your Music To"
>
> or
>
> "Built on Excellence. Dedicated to Your Vision."

---

#### First paragraph — credential dump feels like Sage, not Hero

**Current:**
> "I offer independent and major label artists boutique and refined sound forged by over 15 years in the music industry..."

Hero archetype doesn't just *list* achievements — it demonstrates a **relentless standard.** Caregiver wraps it in *why it matters for the artist.*

**Suggested:**
> "For 15 years, I've held every song I touch to the same standard that produced Diamond-certified hits and Grammy-winning albums. Records for Taylor Swift, Adele, OneRepublic, and Ariana Grande didn't happen by luck — they were built with obsessive attention to detail, relentless iteration, and total commitment to the song. That's the exact process I now bring to you."

---

#### Second paragraph — solid, but add Caregiver warmth

**Current:**
> "I partner with artists to transform their raw ideas..."

**Suggested:**
> "I partner with artists to transform raw ideas into polished, commercially competitive records — and I do it by **protecting your creative identity** at every step. You'll never lose yourself in the process. My sound is built on a backbone of authentic vocals woven into textured drums and unique sound design."

---

#### Third paragraph — throwaway as-is

**Current:**
> "Now based in Denver, CO, I work with artists around the world..."

Make it a Caregiver close.

**Suggested:**
> "Based in Denver and working with artists worldwide, I'm here to make the process feel as focused and personal as the music we'll create together."

---

### 3. WORK PAGE (`work.html`)

#### Hero intro copy — currently underselling

**Current:**
> "Here is a curated selection of my work. This portfolio showcases songs with both independent artists and major label acts across various genres."

This is purely informational (Sage).

**Suggested:**
> "Every song here was held to one standard: the best it could possibly be. From independent artists to major-label acts, this is what happens when you combine raw talent with world-class production."

---

#### "Client Success In Film & Television" subtitle

**Current:**
> "My clients' music has been featured in major films and TV shows, a testament to the broadcast-quality sound we achieve together."

Good Caregiver touch with "we achieve together." Strengthen the Hero.

**Suggested:**
> "When your music sounds this good, Hollywood notices. These placements are a testament to the broadcast-ready standard we achieve together."

---

#### CTA — "Ready to create your best work?"

This is actually well-balanced. **Keep it.**

---

### 4. LANDING PAGE (`landing-page-national.html`)

**This is your strongest page.** It already hits the archetype blend well:
- Hero: "Major Label Sound for Independent Artists"
- Caregiver: "From The Sound In Your Head To The Final Master" + the empathy paragraph
- Caregiver: "More Than A Producer — A Partner In Your Sound"

#### One improvement — the "Dream Outcome" section

**Current:**
> "You can stop worrying about the technical hurdles and focus on what you do best: being an artist."

This is pure Caregiver — beautiful. But add a subtle Hero line to balance.

**Suggested:**
> "You can stop worrying about the technical hurdles and focus on what you do best: being an artist. I'll handle the rest, and I'll hold it to a standard that speaks for itself."

---

#### CTA — "Ready to bring your music to life?"

**Current:**
> "Let's talk about how we can transform your song into a professional, competitive record."

Add Caregiver safety.

**Suggested:**
> "Let's talk about how we can transform your song into a professional, competitive record. No pressure, no commitment — just a conversation about your music."

---

### 5. THANK YOU PAGES

**Current:**
> "I've received your details and will do my best to respond within 24 hours..."

This is good Caregiver. Strengthen with Hero confidence.

**Suggested:**
> "I've received your message and I will respond within 24 hours, Monday through Friday. I'm looking forward to learning about your music and showing you what's possible."

*Note: "will do my best" is hedging language — the Hero doesn't hedge.*

## Archetype Language Cheatsheet

| Archetype | Words/Phrases TO USE | Words/Phrases to AVOID |
|---|---|---|
| **Hero (70%)** | "excellence," "standard," "uncompromising," "elevate," "mastery," "world-class," "proven," "the best it can be," "hold to a standard" | "try," "hopefully," "do my best," "pretty good," passive constructions |
| **Caregiver (25%)** | "your vision," "protect," "partner," "together," "safe space," "I listen," "dedicated to you," "personally," "trust" | Self-centered framing without connecting back to the artist's benefit |
| **Sage (5%)** | "what separates good from great," "I've learned," "understanding," "insight" | Long credential lists without tying them to a standard or benefit |

---

## The Core Shift

**Stop leading with credentials (Sage) and start leading with standard/mastery (Hero), then wrap it in care for the artist (Caregiver).** The credentials should *prove* the standard — not *be* the message.
